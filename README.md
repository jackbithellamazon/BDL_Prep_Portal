# BDL PrepHub

The Bithell Distribution prep app: Prep Sheet, Sarah's Admin, Jack's Admin, Lavarion, Recovery Stock, Shipments, Insights. One page, served by GitHub Pages, data in Supabase.

## What's in here

| Folder / file | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The page itself — the layout only. Loads everything below. |
| `css/` | How it looks. One file per area: `base`, `prep`, `modals`, `closeoff`, `pages`, `lavarion`, `followup`, `auth`, `unify`, `lavarion-overrides`. |
| `js/` | What it does. One file per area, loaded in order: `core` (shared helpers) → `rules` (the rules every save obeys, and who owns a row) → `prep` → `claims` → `sarah-admin` → `closeoff` → `recovery` → `jack-admin` → `admin-queue` → `dashboard` → `lavarion-bridge` → `insights` → `audit-ean` → `ui` → `stock-moves` → `shipments` → `sheet-sync` → `db` (Supabase) → `issues` → `returns` → `boot` → `lavarion`. |
| `tests/checks.js` | The agreed workflows, as checks. Run from the TEST MODE build ("Run the checks" on the red bar). A build only ships when they are all green. |
| `README-DEPLOY.txt` | The three-step upload. |

## Updating the live app

1. GitHub → **Add file → Upload files**.
2. Drag the **contents** of the dated build folder in (`index.html`, `css`, `js`, `tests`, the two READMEs) — not the folder itself.
3. **Commit changes**. Pages redeploys within a minute. Same URL, same logins.

Rollback: upload the previous dated folder the same way.

## Rules of the house

- The app never writes the Google Sheet.
- Nothing is ever deleted — rows are filed (archived) and stay in history.
- Every change to a row goes through `saveRow`, which runs the rules in `js/rules.js` and writes an audit line.
- "Is this row finished, and whose is it?" has one answer: `_rowOwner` in `js/rules.js`. Every list reads it.
- Test in TEST MODE (nothing saves there), never on live.

Build number: in `js/lavarion.js` (`BUILD`) and on Settings.
